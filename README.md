#gtaiv-trainer
These features were added first for me, while I was experimenting, and then to provide the community with some examples of native usage.

only for CitizenIV.


## How to open the menu ? 
- Controller : Back button
- Keyboard   : (?) for azerty (M) for qwerty.

## Is this complete ?
Well from now it is not, I don't have much time to keep the work on, I will try to add more features when I got more time and motivation.
